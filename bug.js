This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom camera component. The issue is that the camera preview does not render correctly when the component is first mounted, resulting in a blank screen. After a few seconds or after interacting with the component, the preview suddenly appears. This inconsistent behavior makes the app unreliable and provides a poor user experience.
