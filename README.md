# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where the camera preview doesn't render immediately when using a custom component. The preview initially shows a blank screen, and only appears after a delay or user interaction.

## Bug Description
The issue occurs specifically when integrating the Expo Camera API into a custom component. Upon mounting the component, the camera preview area remains blank. After some time (a few seconds), or after interacting with other parts of the UI, the camera preview suddenly renders correctly. This inconsistent behavior leads to a poor user experience, making the app appear broken or unresponsive.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
4. Observe the initial blank screen and the eventual appearance of the camera preview.

## Solution
The solution involves using a combination of `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the camera component's lifecycle effectively and explicitly request camera permissions. This ensures that the camera preview is mounted and properly rendered.
